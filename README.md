This is a fintess app I built for use in the gym. It currently collects data from both cardio and weight lifting workouts and store the data. The App uses Foundation 5 as the front-end framework and utilizes jQuery for funcionality. The back-end is written in PHP and is designed to store data in an SQL database.
